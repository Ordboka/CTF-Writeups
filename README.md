# CTF-Writeups
Writeups from any CTF challenge I want to write a writeup for. I mainly focus on cryptography, so my writeups will likely reflect that.

## Crypto
### Hash functions
[SHA256-CTR SDCTF2023](SDCTF2023/SHA256-CTR) Hash length extension attack\
[WinterIsComing WackCTF2024](WackCTF2024/WinterIsComing) Novel signature scheme based on repeated hashing

### Discrete log
[crack_the_safe UIUCTF2023](UIUCTF2023/crack_the_safe) Pohlig-Hellman algorithm on kinda smooth $p-1$
